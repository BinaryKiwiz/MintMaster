I mean, have you ever just looked for a good idle game for so long
Well, that is what I have been doing for almost a year now
It has been so long that I decided to make my own Incremental
I hope you like it it will always be a work in progress.
I will allways be updating, adding new features, more gameplay, and fixing bugs whenever I have tie.
